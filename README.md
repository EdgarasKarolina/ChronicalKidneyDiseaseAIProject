# Chronical Kidney Disease AI Project

Chronical Kidney Disease is one of several kidney diseases that results a gradual loss of kidney functionality which could lead to death. According to the statistics there were around 323 millions of people in the entire world which were affected by one or another form of this disease.

Chronic kidney disease is a growing problem world-wide and therefore it is important to bring some more attention to it. CKD is comprised of 5 different stages and there are ways that the progression of kidney failure could be slowed down or stopped. Therefore it is very important to be able to discover people which are likely to have developed CKD as soon as possible.

This project is based on Artificial Intelligence and it can be used in early discovery of patients who have developed CKD by looking in a number (24 in total) of factors which are said to be helpful while trying to indicate if a person has actually developed CKD.

The program is processing the data gathered by various hospitals and using it to train Supervised Learning models which later on are tested in order to see how good they are in making predictions if a person has developed CKD. 

Machine Learning algorithms used in the project:
+ Gaussian NB
+ Multinomial NB
+ Bernoulli NB
+ Random Forest
+ Logistic Regression
+ Logistic Regression CV

## Data used

Data was gathered from hospitals across India.

Number of instances: 400
